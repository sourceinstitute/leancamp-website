What’s involved in organising a Leancamp or Source Summit.

### T-Minus: 12 weeks

- Organizing team of 2 or 3 people is finalized.
- 30min kick off meeting with either Leancamp Falicitator.
- Landing page opened.   Start building the email list for interested participants.

### T-Minus: 11 weeks

- List of possible venues created.   Hosting invitations sent.

**Target:** 4 venues contacted.


### T-Minus: 10 weeks

- Budget created:  Sit down with your Advisors to walk you through the budget of previous  events. Then make your budget together. This takes around 30-40  minutes.

**Target:** 150 emails signed up before moving on. Go/no-go based on signups.


### T-Minus: 9 weeks
