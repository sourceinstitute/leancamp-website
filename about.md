## Learn Lean from the source.
Leancamp is an open conference where you set the topics.  You’ll meet people engaged in startups, corporations and a range of related fields — all sharing their experience in the name of progressing the state-of-the-art.

Leancamp is where many of the recent advances in startup thinking have taken place. The power of combining multiple communities of practice, and drawing on the strengths of a range of cities leads to rapid progress.

Everyone has the power to drive the Leancamp agenda, to contribute their experience, and to bring their challenges to thought-leaders and experienced founders who are creating faster ways to get traction.

Since participants drive the topics based on their needs, Leancamp is more timely and relevant than traditional conference formats – this is why we call it an un-conference!

**Over 98% of Leancamp participants leave with actionable insight** that they apply within a week or less, and most make long-lasting connections to collaborators and advisors.

## What happens at Leancamp?
Generalities and dogmatism have no place at Leancamp.  We focus on what people have done, and how it actually went. Leancamp is about sharing what’s new, not repeating the same tired axioms from the past.

Being an un conference there is no  pre-determined agenda. The agenda of each LeanCamp is made by the participants for the participants – facilitated by a Leancamp leader on the morning of the conference.

Anyone with a question, or willing to share their experience fill out a session card and briefly describe to everyone else what they’d like to learn or share. Proposing a session doesn’t take more than 30 seconds.

After the session is presented, the audience will show interest to the session by a show of hands. If the session generates enough early interest it will have a time and space allocated.

The only job of the initiator now is to make sure the proposed session starts on time and ends on time. Easy!

The sessions themselves are very interactive and open-ended, and most are run through pre-selected formats to help make sure they’re valuable.  Topics tend to be explored from new perspectives, and lots of practical advice is shared.
